# Desafio Neomind

## Purpose: 
The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate your skill and knowledge of logic of programming.

<br>

## The Problem: 
Write a program where, given a given time, it is able to
Calculate the angle between the 2 clock hands.

 - Premise:
    1. Consider:
        - 00:00h has an angle of 0Â°
        - 00:15h has an angle of 90Â°
        - 00:30 h has an angle of 180Â°
        2. Method signature:
            - int retornaAnguloRelogio (int hora, int minuto);
        3. The challenge must be solved by writing in Java or natural language.
        4. If you have any doubts, make the decision that you think is the best.
    - Reply:
        ```` 
        Public int retornaAnguloRelogio (int hora, int minuto) { 
            // Implement the rest of the method
        }
        ````
